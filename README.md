This is my first project using the react library with typescript

The code in this project is not by any means godlike, but its a milestone I can reflect on
when I improve as a developer

I wish I could add more features and fix certian attrubites, but I cannot spend another day
on it because at some point it'll feel like a chore rather than a fun project

That's about it cya

I use vim and arch BTW
