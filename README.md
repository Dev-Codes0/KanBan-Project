This is my first project using the React library with TypeScript

The code in this project is not by any means godlike, but it's a milestone I can reflect on when I improve as a developer

I wish I could add more features and fix certain attributes, but I cannot spend another day on it because, at some point, it'll feel like a chore rather than a fun project

That's about it, cya

I use vim and arch BTW
